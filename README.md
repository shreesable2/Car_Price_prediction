# Car_Price_prediction

This is a machine learning project that predicts the price of used cars based on their features such as horsepower, enginesize, citympg and other relevant factors.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from https://github.com/amankharwal/Website-data and contains information about cars from various car brands. The dataset has over 200 observations with 26 features, including the target variable (price).

#Methodology
We have used a regression model to predict the price of used cars. We have performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and preprocess the data for model training. We have used Random Forest Regression machine learning algorithm to build the regression model.

#Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Numpy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

os

#Results
We have evaluated the performance of the model using accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics. The final model has an accuracy_score of 0.88. This indicates that the model has a good fit and can predict the price of used cars accurately.

#Usage
To use the model, you can input the features of the car (horsepower, enginesize etc.) into the trained model, and it will predict the price of the car based on the input.
